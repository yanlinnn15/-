- A novel heterogeneous ensemble model for churn prediction in the telecom industry. 

- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of customer data.

- Employed data pre-processing techniques to handle class imbalance and enhance model performance.

- Integrated multiple base classifiers including convolutional-based neural network, logistic regression, decision tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

- Utilized a stacking ensemble technique to combine the strengths of individual classifiers and improve prediction accuracy.

- Evaluated the proposed model on a real-world dataset, Cell2Cell, demonstrating superior performance with a 62.4% F1-score and 60.62% recall.
